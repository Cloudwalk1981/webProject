                <p>I have always been very passionate about logic and maths. 20 years ago I tried to enter the IT
                    environment by taking an Advanced GNVQ in IT as this subject appealed to both of my passions and my
                    sense of order. Sadly, life has a way of altering even the best laid plans and personal issues
                    forced me
                    to leave the course after only a month. I had learned a little about Q-Basic and some of the
                    fundamentals of coding and logic progression, but nothing more.<br />
                    <br />
                    Twenty years later my life is altered by forces outside of my control once again and I had to take
                    time
                    off
                    employment due to a health issue. But, serendipity struck and I remembered a brief conversation with
                    Erza, one of the admissions assistants for Code Nation. We had spoken briefly at an open day and
                    although I was extremely interested from day one, I didnâ€™t have the means to leave my job to attend
                    this
                    course. I specifically remember him saying that if I were in receipt of any benefits then the course
                    would likely be funded by the government.<br />
                    <br />
                    Well, I sent an email, enrolled on the course and I have not looked back. I have enjoyed almost
                    every
                    moment of my time here and I am very likely going to apply for a position on the master course that
                    starts next year.
